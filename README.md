Travel Minder v4.0

This application was conceived in 2004 for EnCana Corporation's Travel & Aviation department. It has since undergone two full rewrites and several major revisions, and became the basis for a startup.

The application allows companies to track employee travel, spend and risk profile. Visas, security clearances, vaccinations and emergency contacts are tracked, as well as the usual flight, hotel and vehicle preferences.

The application is a rich thin client based on GWT with a Java backend. MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB have all been used in either embedded or cloud-based (Google, AWS) implementations.
